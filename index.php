    <p>Three years ago Lauren mentioned an idea she'd had to Kyle, whom she had just met. The idea
    was to use github—a tool used for tracking versions of code in collaborative software
    projects—to track a romantic relationship. She called it <i>gitogether</i>.</p>

    <p>“That's so good!” he said.<br>“I can't believe nobody has done it yet.”
    she said, so she did.<br>So they did.</p>

    <p>“What if we could commit at points that seem stable and good, and revert back if we mess up.
    Could we make an experimental branch and merge it in only if it works out? Maybe cherry pick patches from
    the source of someone else's good relationship?”</p>

    <p>“Sometimes we're asking: what can relationships learn from software development? 
    Or, how will the repository be reflected in the relationship? Other times we're 
    asking: what is the most accurate way of recording the natural course of a relationship 
    within the context of distributed version control systems?”
    </p>

    <img class='border' style='margin: 25px 0 45px 0' src='imgs/issue.PNG'/>
    <img src='imgs/readme_update.png'/>

    <p>“I like the similarity between what I feel getting into a new relationship with 
    someone and creating a new repo—a sense that it could be a potentially bad idea
     that wastes a lot of time but you believe there is some possibility it's worth doing.”</p>

    <b>CEREMONY</b>
    <p>
      The ceremony will take place at <a href='http://stmarksbowery.org' target='_blank'>St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery</a>.<br>
      131 E. 10th St, New York, NY 10003<br><br>
      An East Village landmark dating back to 1799, St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery is hallowed ground for devotees of avant-garde arts and local Episcopalians alike. Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham danced here in the 20s and 30s, and the Danspace Project, founded in 1974, continues that legacy with a full schedule of performances. Literature has been just as revered: The late, great Allen Ginsberg was a recurring participant in the church's resident Poetry Project (a nationally recognized force). Furthermore, St. Mark's has been a happy home for legendary experimental theater auteur Richard Foreman.
