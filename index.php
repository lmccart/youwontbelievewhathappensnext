    Kyle and Lauren are getting married<br>
    on June 4, 2016 in New York, New York.

    <p>Three years ago I mentioned an idea I'd had to Kyle, whom I had just met. The idea
    was to use github—a tool that we use for tracking versions of code in collaborative software
    projects—to track a romantic relationship. I called it <i>gitogether</i>.</p>

    <p>"That's so good!" he said.<br>"I can't believe nobody has done it yet."
    I said, so I did.<br>So we did.</p>

    <p>Sometimes we're asking: what can relationships learn from software development? 
    Or, how will the repository be reflected in the relationship? Other times we're 
    asking: what is the most accurate way of recording the natural course of a relationship 
    within the context of distributed version control systems?
    </p>

    <p>I like the similarity between what I feel getting into a new relationship with 
    someone and creating a new repo—a sense that it could be a potentially bad idea
     that wastes a lot of time but you believe there is some possibility it's worth doing.</p>

    <b>CEREMONY</b>
    <p>
      The ceremony will take place at <a href='http://stmarksbowery.org' target='_blank'>St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery</a>.<br>
      131 E. 10th St, New York, NY 10003<br><br>
      An East Village landmark dating back to 1799, St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery is hallowed ground for devotees of avant-garde arts and local Episcopalians alike. Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham danced here in the 20s and 30s, and the Danspace Project, founded in 1974, continues that legacy with a full schedule of performances. Literature has been just as revered: The late, great Allen Ginsberg was a recurring participant in the church's resident Poetry Project (a nationally recognized force). Furthermore, St. Mark's has been a happy home for legendary experimental theater auteur Richard Foreman.
